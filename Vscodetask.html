            <h1 align="center">Visual Studio Code</h1>
            <p>Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs including websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms including Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Microsoft Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.</p>
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>Visual Studio does not support any programming language, solution or tool intrinsically; instead, it allows the plugging of functionality coded as a VSPackage. When installed, the functionality is available as a Service. The IDE provides three services: SVsSolution, which provides the ability to enumerate projects and solutions; SVsUIShell, which provides windowing and UI functionality (including tabs, toolbars, and tool windows); and SVsShell, which deals with registration of VSPackages. In addition, the IDE is also responsible for coordinating and enabling communication between services.[10] All editors, designers, project types and other tools are implemented as VSPackages. Visual Studio uses COM to access the VSPackages. The Visual Studio SDK also includes the Managed Package Framework (MPF), which is a set of managed wrappers around the COM-interfaces that allow the Packages to be written in any CLI compliant language.[11] However, MPF does not provide all the functionality exposed by the Visual Studio COM interfaces.[12] The services can then be consumed for creation of other packages, which add functionality to the Visual Studio IDE.</p>
            <h2>Features of Visual Studio Code</h2>
            <h3><u>Code editor</u></h3>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Visual Studio includes a code editor that supports syntax highlighting and code completion using IntelliSense for variables, functions, methods, loops, and LINQ queries</li>
                <li>IntelliSense is supported for the included languages, as well as for XML, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript when developing web sites and web applications.</li>
                <li>Autocomplete suggestions appear in a modeless list box over the code editor window, in proximity of the editing cursor. In Visual Studio 2008 onwards, it can be made temporarily semi-transparent to see the code obstructed by it</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3><u>Debugging:</u></h3>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Visual Studio includes a debugger that works both as a source-level debugger and as a machine-level debugger</li>
                <li>It works with both managed code as well as native code and can be used for debugging applications written in any language supported by Visual Studio.</li>
                <li>In addition, it can also attach to running processes, monitor, and debug those processes</li>
            </ul>
